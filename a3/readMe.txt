Question 1) Spent a while trying to figure out how to turn IO string to string, stackoverflow kept saying you couldn't. Saw read the next day at lecture and everything was fine again. 1a was brief and easy.
Question 3) Spent around 5 hours. Most of it was spent on 3a debugging. Learnt how to write do and how to use packages like readFile.
