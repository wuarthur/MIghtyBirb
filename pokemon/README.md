# We Gonna Edit Dis in Future for the Benefit of TAs and our Grade Ofc





This is Hao, I apologize for not feeling well on Friday, so I kind just did nothing.
I've update this proj with some more work since then tho.

Please check out.


-------- game.pl
-------- loader2.pl
-------- selectpokemon.pl
-------- battle.pl
-------- userio.pl
-------- utils.pl


I decided to do everything in triples like Prof said in class, makes things very convenient.



**Carol***
I've added some comments to battle.pl and more importantly game.pl
Could you add some sample queries? I couldn't get them to work for some reason
We've made it to creating teams too. We would probably scrap our code tho because I really had
no idea what I was doing and your code is very neat.
