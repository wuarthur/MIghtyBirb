# We Gonna Edit Dis in Future for the Benefit of TAs and our Grade Ofc





This is Hao, I apologize for not feeling well on Friday, so I kind just did nothing.
I've update this proj with some more work since then tho.

Please check out.


-------- game.pl
-------- loader2.pl
-------- selectpokemon.pl
-------- battle.pl
-------- userio.pl
-------- utils.pl


I decided to do everything in triples like Prof said in class, makes things very convenient.

I've added some comments to battle.pl and more importantly game.pl
Could you add some sample queries? I couldn't get them to work for some reason
We've made it to creating teams too. We would probably scrap our code tho because I really had
no idea what I was doing and your code is very neat.

I just figured that since I can't write prolog in prolog, ill just write haskell in prolog lmao. Better than those
java programmers who write java in every language they come across.
We should talk in person or maybe over skype about queries, its too much work to add them in at this stage imo,
especially since we are gonna be likely to change those up and they will get outdated. I already changed the
impl of quite a few functions since I got the logic wrong.

Also updated the battle.pl, so hopefully the logic is right now :)

left questions on userio
